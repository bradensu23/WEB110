    <p>I have a long-standing background in graphic design and screen printing. I started Zepher Printing in high school, which eventually grew into The Zepher Company. Today, I focus primarily on commercial graphic design - creating logos, branding materials, and vehicle graphics for businesses. I install vinyl graphics, produce custom apparel, and sell promotional products to a wide range of clients across Kansas and beyond.</p>
